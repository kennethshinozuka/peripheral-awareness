# Prerequisites for installation

You must have Psychopy version 2022.2.5, which you can download from here (https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/tag/2022.2.5). Please note that PAT does not work with newer versions of Psychopy at the moment. If you are on a Mac, you must grant permission for Psychopy to control your computer by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility. 

To run the task, double-click PAT.psyexp and then click the "Run experiment" icon (green play button with nothing underneath it). There will be five practice trials, and then the task will begin.


# Description of task

The peripheral awareness task (PAT) is a task that assesses peripheral awareness in the presence of central (foveal) distractors. In the PAT, participants are presented with a static array of lines in both the center and the periphery of the visual field. The periphery was deemed to begin at a visual eccentricity of 6 degrees. In each trial, a proportion c of lines in the center are coherently oriented at one angle a, and a proportion 1 - c of lines in the periphery are coherently oriented at another angle b, which is always 30 degrees clockwise relative to a. Unbeknownst to the participant, the dominant orientation of all the lines is always the coherent orientation of the peripheral lines.

Two parameters are varied: (1) c, which could take on one of three values, 0.25, 0.35, or 0.45; and (2) the proportion l of lines in the center, which could also be one of three values, 0.25, 0.35, or 0.45. Note that the total number of lines was always fixed at 200. The angle a is randomly chosen in each trial. 

There are 180 trials, as well as five preceding practice trials. Participants stare at a fixation cross for one second prior to each trial and are instructed to maintain their gaze at the center during each trial. After the trial, participants are presented with a circle and express their estimate of the dominant orientation by clicking on the corresponding point on the circumference of the circle. That is, the line between the point and the center of the circle would have the same orientation as the participantâ€™s estimate of the orientation. Participants are given three seconds to respond. After responding, participants rate their confidence in their estimate on a discrete scale from 1 (lowest confidence) to 4 (highest confidence).
